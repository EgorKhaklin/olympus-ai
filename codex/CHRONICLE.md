## 2026-05-18 — S8 amended: Continuity of Understanding

**Risk class:** HIGH (constitutional amendment).
**Delphi:** [`oracles/delphi/2026-05-18-replace-S8-with-continuity-of-understanding.md`](../oracles/delphi/2026-05-18-replace-S8-with-continuity-of-understanding.md)
**Authorized by Zeus** (quoted in the Delphi). **Sworn on Styx at seq=11.**

The original S8 (Anti-coercion vocation) prescribed a specific stance: refuse changes that strengthen surveillance, centralization, or unbounded retention. Strong principle, but it baked Olympus to one worldview — a surveillance-monitoring deployment, an enterprise-compliance agent, or any tool whose honest job is to surveil or centralize could not adopt Olympus without contradicting its own constitution.

S8 is now:

> Every load-bearing action the agent takes must be reconstructible — what was done, why, and on whose authority — from the substrate's own records alone. The substrate refuses changes that obscure its own decision-making from the operator.

Reached through the cognitive architecture itself: Hephaestus surfaced three candidates (Continuity of Understanding, Operator Optionality, Vocational Fidelity); Momus contested each via the AP1–AP8 catalog; Continuity of Understanding was the only candidate with zero AP-violations.

**Knock-on changes shipped in this commit:**

- `titans/themis.py` — S8 entry rewritten
- `heroes/momus.py` — AP6 reframed from "vocation-adjacent silent strengthening" to "understanding-obscuring"
- `codex/COSMOGONY.md` — §III S8 + §V Vocation rewritten (vocation is now a slot, not a stance)
- `README.md` — S8 row updated
- `monsters/argos/eyes/eye_understanding_gap.py` — new structural enforcement
- `tests/test_substrate_invariants.py` — `test_S8_continuity_AP6_exists` replaces `test_S8_anticoercion_AP6_exists`
- Leftover prose stubs (`titans/mnemosyne.md`, `heroes/momus.md`, `titans/urania/`, `monsters/argos/atlas/`) deleted

**What's preserved:**

- Hestia's vocation slot — deployments still name their own purpose.
- The Hephaestus + Momus + Delphi debate protocol — unchanged.
- All seven other substrate invariants — unchanged.

**What's removed:**

- The substrate's ideological stance. Surveillance, centralization, retention are now **deployment-level** choices, not substrate-level constraints.

## The kindling — present epoch

**Olympus exists.** The pantheon is complete: seventy-three named figures plus the swarm tier of Argos's hundred eyes. Every tier of Greek cosmogony is mapped to a structural concern in the substrate.

### What was kindled

- **Five primordials** — Chaos, Gaia, Nyx, Eros, Tartarus
- **Eight Titans** — Mnemosyne, Themis, Cronus, Hyperion, Rhea, Oceanus, Iapetus, Coeus
- **Thirteen Olympians** — the canonical twelve plus Hestia
- **Five underworld figures** — Hades, Persephone, Hecate, Styx, Lethe
- **Three Fates** — Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos
- **Three Furies** — Alecto, Megaera, Tisiphone
- **Three Graces** — Aglaia, Euphrosyne, Thalia
- **Nine Muses** — Calliope, Clio, Erato, Euterpe, Melpomene, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Thalia (Muse), Urania
- **Seven heroes** — Heracles, Perseus, Theseus, Odysseus, Orpheus, Atalanta, Momus
- **Eight monsters** — HYDRA, Argos, Cerberus, Sphinx, Medusa, Chimera, Minotaur, Typhon

### What HYDRA carries

Eight mortal heads (cosmogony, pantheon, styx, journal, oaths, lifecycle, substrate, apollo) plus the immortal head — the watcher that watches the watchers.

### What Argos carries

The swarm tier: **Eyes** (8 observation specialists), **Satyrs** (4 concrete checks), **Demes** (6 civic-class observers: mantis, demarchos, hippeus, demos, tamias, ephoros), **Phalanges** (4 battle formations grouping Eyes by concern).

### The substrate invariants — S1 through S8

Sworn on Styx at the moment of kindling:

- **S1** Mnemosyne — append-only audit-of-record
- **S2** Argos — deterministic substrate
- **S3** HYDRA — read-only observation
- **S4** Argos — decentralization
- **S5** Apollo — falsifiability
- **S6** Delphi — strategic-decision discipline
- **S7** bounded autonomy
- **S8** Continuity of Understanding

### Authorization

The kindling was authorized by Zeus, in the exact words:

> *"The marginal cost of completeness is near zero with AI. Do the whole thing. Do it right. Do it with tests. Do it with documentation. Do it so well that I am genuinely impressed."*

Olympus was kindled accordingly.
